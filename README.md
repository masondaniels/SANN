# SANN
Simple Artificial Neural Network
## Status
SANN is a project which will probably collect dust. Though, my hope for SANN is that I actually work on it. Currently, SANN is non-functional for training (so basically useless). Maybe if I get bored enough one day, I'll add backpropagation. It can calculate given weights, biases, and inputs. It supports only the sigmoid activation function as of now. 
## Usage
The main class serves as an example of its usage. Create a NeuralNetwork by creating a new NeuralNetworkBuilder, then add layers to this builder, then set its activation type, then build. You can then calculate stuff. Too bad you can't train anything yet. Then maybe this would be kinda useful.
